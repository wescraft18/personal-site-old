	<h2>Fame and Fortune: Javascript In Web-Dev</h2>
	<h5>Joey S. - 5/29/14</h5>
	<p>When looking around the world wide web of things to understand why JavaScript is so beloved in the web community, I came across a lot of answers from extremely diverse people. It is important to know that we interact with JS elements on the WEB, quite often and have no idea we do so. This is important because the ubiquity of JS cannot go unnoticed.</p>
	<p>There are a few things that kept coming up as to why JS is beloved, and they are: 
	<ol><li>It is easy to learn</li>
		<li>It is open-source</li>
		<li>It has large libraries</li>
		<li>Browsers support it</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>So, first all, <strong>It is easy to learn</strong>. The language is considered quite intuitive and there are so many tutorials available on the web that even the most novice of programmers have noted ease of use/learning. This is not to say that it will come to you like reading a Harry Potter novel, but with true work and care the language can be learned.</p>
	<p>Second, <strong>It is open-source</strong>. This is a very important aspect in programming as an open-source language gives people the ability to make modifications, improvements, and anything else without the hinderance of a large company watching over you and what you do.</p>
	<p><strong>Great libraries!</strong> This means that there are many little gadgets within JS that can be used to help make your programming more efficient, powerful or even easier. These libraries provide functions written by other developers to possibly do something you are already looking for.</p>
	<p>Finally, <strong>Browsers support it.</strong> There are multiple Internet browsers on the market and you need to be aware that they will interact with your web-site, web code in very different ways. One thing that is static within all that is that JS is supported by all major browsers.</p>
	<h3>Major drawbacks</h3>
	<p>With all the greatness that JavaScript offers, there have to be some drawbacks, right? Well yes, of course. The major drawbacks of JS are that it requires a server-side script, which is a fancy way of saying a 'program/script that lives on the server hosting(or remotely) the website you are seeing.' to communicate to databases and write to files on said server. This is important because JavaScript is running in your browser (making it faster) but that doesn't allow it to have a two-way communication with your computer.</p>
	<p>The biggest drawback, however, is that any user can disable JavaScript on their computer, rendering all the things you wrote in JS, useless.</p>
