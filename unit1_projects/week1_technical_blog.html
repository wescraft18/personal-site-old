	<h5>Joey S. - 5/12/14</h5>
	<p>When asked to look at three websites I found awesome, I knew I had a problem when two of top 3 were Google and Google News. After a little more investigating, I came across these three sites:</p>
	<ol><li><a href="http://thechive.com">theCHIVE</a></li><li><a href="http://espn.com">ESPN</a></li><li><a href="http://smashingmagazine.com">Smashing Magazine</a></li></ol>
	<h3>The Chive</h3>
	<p>First off, I go to this site everyday because I love the community and they happen to have awesome pictures and stories on there quite often. </p>
	<p>When I look at the site, my eye gravitates towards teh white "content" area on the left side of the site. This is mostly due to the heavy dark/light contrast, but also because I know this is where the content lives usually.</p>
	<p>The site is build like a blog so it makes navigating quite simple. You click on a post, see the images and at the end, it recommends more posts to view. It is simple and functional.</p>
	<p>At times, it feels like there is a lot going on within the page, with the posts on the left and hotlinks/ads on the right, but sometimes that's what we are looking for.</p>
	<h3>ESPN</h3>
	<p>My visits to ESPN are frequent and long. I love sports and espn offers a great mix of live and current scores with life stories about sports/athletes.</p>
	<p>ESPN.com's top scoreboard is just about my favorite aspect of the site. It offers what I truly go to the site for, in the most conveinent of places–the top. Also, most of the exciting content is "above the fold" as we say in print. I don't have to make any scrolls to get to my main content, which is a great aspect for print as well as rich media.</p>
	<p>An annoying, but effective aspect of ESPN's site is that they place an leaderboard ad right below the scoreboard and sometimes when you mouse down towards the main content, the ad comes spiraling out. This is a huge annoyance for me, but has to be a great aspect for advertisers. I have, admittedly, stopped and watched a video or two when it opened because it looked interesting.</p>
	<h3>Smashing Magazine</h3>
	<p>I look to Smashing, more often than not, for sweet wallpapers. But they also have excellent articles about the digital world. Oddly enough, when I started writing this I realized they had a different design from the last tiem I opened this site.</p>
	<p>This new design is incredibly sleek and simple looking. The responsive design is also great, as it displays well on my phone as well. Much like TheChive, this site is blog oriented and offers an "infnite scroll" of blog posts. The posts have nice little bits of content to tease and then the option to read more and ALWAYS feature an image. I like the pictures, not gonna lie. Also, the sweet sidebar with great headings makes my search of content/time wasting material more efficient.</p>
