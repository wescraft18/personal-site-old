	<h2>An abstract random thinkers...</h2>
	<h5>Joey S. - 5/30/14</h5>
	<p>Abstract random thinkers have a hard time concentrating on one thing at a time. This has been my biggest hurdle during my time at DBC thus far. I see 9 challenges and I want to do ALL of them at once. This might be an okay thing to try, but I just dont think it helps kme in the long run.</p>
	<p>I'm not entirely sure this is related to my learning style so much as there is a ridiculous amount of outside distractions fighting for my attention on a daily basis. I try and balance, but it sure is difficult.</p>
	<p>My plan to get on track is to use the time management methods we learned about in week two of DBC phase 0. I want to set small time restrictions on what I do intermixed with breaks to help me keep focus without drifting into unncessary items.</p>
	<p>My learning style says I have a hard time working in restrictive enviornments and with explaining things. This is becomes a problem in group settings as my opinion becomes difficult to justify to my group members. I haven't really run into these things yet but have noticed that I tend to take a back seat in a lot of the pairing sessions.</p>
	<p>I want to expand my horizons and learn to take criticism better while being able to express my views and take a confident stance in them. I am on the process of learning and growing.</p>
