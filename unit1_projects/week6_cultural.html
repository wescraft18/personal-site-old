	<h2>We are all just people living on a rock, hurling around space</h2>
	<h5>Joey S. - 6/21/14</h5>
	<p>Pre-disposed notions of a group of a person or group of people are often times harmful and not even necessary. Stereotype threat is the idea that an individual is at <em>risk</em> of confirming a negative stereotype about their individual stereotype group.</p>
	<p>My experiences with stereotype threat in my own life are quite often related to my religion. As a mid-western Muslim, you find that people often expect that I'm directly related to radical Islamic groups, especially post 9-11. The stereotypes are commonly that all Muslims should be wearing a turban, and have anti American views. I will say that today, a lot of these stereotypes are less prevalent as we have learned much more about the Islamic community since that tragic day.</p>
	<p>To handle stereotype threat I think education is society's best option. Whenever it feels like this may be happening, I try to jump and and prove them wrong about their pre-conceived notions. Educate them about who you are and how your group is more than just what mainstream media portrays. Be the alternative, and hopefully that will help people realize their mind is wrapped in a bubble.</p>
	<p>For me, educating individuals on group depth and how wrong stereotypes are is actually a bit easier than it may be for other groups. I see it when I go to airports and I hear people chattering when they see a Shiite Muslim, whom is traditionally dressed what people believe to be the world's only Muslims, and inform them that their fear of that group has to also be of myself. At times, just seeing the stereotype eliminated in their presence can open their minds and move people one step closer to stereotype elimination.</p>
