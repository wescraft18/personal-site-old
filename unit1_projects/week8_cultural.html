	<h2>"a serious disagreement or argument, typically a protracted one."</h2>

	<p>That is the definition of a conflict, according to Google. I experience a conflict at work on a daily basis. It is the nature of working with so many different people at any given time. Opinions will differ, ideas will clash and that is the nature of the beast.</p>
	<h3>Personal conflict</h3>
	<p>A typical conflict is the difference of personal taste. As a designer, we have developed our own taste in items and believe that is the end all situation in a lot of cases. Well, we aren't the only ones that see things this way. A lot of our clients have an idea in their mind of what they want an end product to look like so when it isn't <em>exactly</em> that, heads will clash. </p>
	<h3>Source of the conflict</h3>
	<p>The source of one typical conflict was that what I believed was a good design wasn't the same as what my client believed was a good design for the specified project.</p>
	<h3>How was it handled?</h3>
	<p>I handle most all of my conflicts at work the same way; as they are the client and I am, essentially, designing the piece for them I try to make my case and accept that their decision is final. For the specific conflict I recommended a certain layout for a piece, bringing emphasis to an area of the print material that I felt was important but the client thought overshadowed what they believed was the main concern. So, in the end, I did what the client asked and they were happy.</p>
	<h3>How did my actions affect the conflict?</h3>
	<p>Well, I think my actions made that specific conflict better but in the long run it has an adverse affect on my ability to sell my point. As a constant push-over, my opinion is heard I'm sure, but my customers probably know that I will give them what they want, even if I think it isn't a great product.</p>
	<h3>Looking forward</h3>
	<p>Things I really want to do moving forward are to be more assertive in my ideas and my skills as a professional and make stronger cases for what I think may be useful/effective in the world that is my profession. Going back I wouldn't really change much as the client was happy and the job got done on time, however. Also, in a deadline driven field, sometimes you don't have time to argue your point with someone that isn't willing to 'see it your way'.</p>
