	<h2>To the front of the CLASS</h2>
	<h5>Joey S. - 6/19/14</h5>

	<p>Class methods are called on a class. This is the major difference between a class method and an instance method. To run a method from a class method you will need to run the class on the method, as depicted below.</p>
	<blockquote class="code">
	class SweetClass<br />
	&nbsp def self.class_method <br />
	&nbsp&nbsp puts "This method was run as a class method."<br />
	&nbsp end<br /><br />

	&nbsp def instance_method<br />
	&nbsp&nbsp puts "This method was run from an instance."<br />
	&nbsp end<br />
	end<br /><br><br>
	instance = SweetClass.new<br>
	SweetClass.class_method<br>
	SweetClass.instance_method<br>
	>>"This method was run as a class method."<br>
	>>NoMethodError: undefined method 'instance_method' for SweetClass:Class
	</blockquote>
	<p>The method that assigns the class to itself returns the proper input, but the instance_method method, which is run within the class, comes up with a <b>NoMethodError</b> as new instance was created of the class, well, it was created but it didn't get called.</p>
	<blockquote class="code">
	class SweetClass<br />
	&nbsp def self.class_method <br />
	&nbsp&nbsp puts "This method was run as a class method."<br />
	&nbsp end<br /><br>
	&nbsp def instance_method<br />
	&nbsp&nbsp puts "This method was run from an instance."<br />
	&nbsp end<br />
	end<br /><br>
	------------------------------<br>
	instance = SweetClass.new<br>
	SweetClass.class_method<br>
	SweetClass.instance_method<br>
	>>"This method was run as a class method."<br>
	>>NoMethodError: undefined method 'instance_method' for SweetClass:Class<br><br>
	------------------------------<br>
	instance.instance_method<br>
	instance.class_method<br>
	>>"This method was run from an instance."<br>
	>>NoMethodError: undefined method class_method for #SweetClass:30303
	</blockquote>
	<p>So running the instance on a method in the class returns the proper response, but running the instance on the class method returns a <b>NoMethodError</b> that we saw before. This is, according to a lot of sites, something heavily used in Rails for ActiveRecord. But more on that later, I'm sure.</p>
	<p>Consensus for class method use was to shorten code and remove initialization of variables. Also, not having to create a state for each method, just passing self instead, saves a lot of time and cleans up code. I haven't really had the opportunity to use a class method and have primarily worked in instance methods, but I will definitely be trying now!</p>
