	<h2>Cloud computing is crazy!</h2>
	<h5>Joey S. - 6/8/14</h5>
	<p>A lot of computing is shifting towards mobile, and these smaller devices require a lot more resources and data storage. A large problem facing the tech world will be to ensure there is enough computing power to power cloud computing to mobile devices. Also, our needs for public storage will increase and this will require more infrastructure and networks to complete these tasks.</p>
	<p>The computing power is a large factor regarding cloud computing but as more companies begin to store their information in the cloud and on servers not in-house security also becomes a concern. High efforts for stronger security will be needed moving forward.</p>
