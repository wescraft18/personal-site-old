	<h2>Oh what fun it is to pair!</h2>
	<h5>Joey S. - 6/12/14</h5>
	<p>It feels like pairing in the coding world is ubiqutous and necessary. The first time you get ready for your pairing session a whole slew of nerves swarm you as you are entering a brand new world (at least to us first-timers). I was almost certain my pair would have started talking and I wouldn't understand the concepts they understood and the entire session would have been for naught, but that was not the case. Each pair, I learned a new way to work with people and got excited about the propsect of having help on a problem, someone to turn to when I hit a wall-and that someon isn't named Google.</p>
	<h3>Pairing</h3>
	<p>Pairing with others to solve challenges is nerve wrecking the first few times you do it, then you realize you have an eager, educated, and similar minded person sitting (virtually) next to you. Once you get past the fear, it turns into a great way to just communicate and learn. It is important that you come open-minded and realize that all your own ideas may not be the best and that you are as capable as the person across from you to complete these challenges.</p>
	<p>I have already learned quite a bit of new techniques and tricks by pairing, and also have completed challenges that I am certain would have taken me much longer to do alone. I have also become familiar with the process, one that will be part of my programming life moving forward.</p>
	<p>My biggest quam with peer pairing is requirement limits on them. We are asked to complete x amount of sessions a week/unit and it makes it a bit difficult because we need to do this within our accountability group. It seems as if some people are not on the same week or are moving at different speeds we cannot properly pair in a timely fashion. During pairing it is still confusing to truly understand who is driving/navigating and what those roles entail. I think this is something that will get easier as time goes on, however.</p>
	<h3>Feedback</h3>
	<p>The feedback was an extremely nerve wrecking part of these sessions. I would frequently check to see if there were any updates to this as I just had to know how I was doing. They are an important way to learn and keep improving on your pairing and coding so I took the feedback as not an attack/compliment on myself, but how I reacted in the sessions.</p>
	<p>A bit of my feedback instructed me to slow down and really think about what I'm saying/doing. I actually receive this feedback at work and in my daily life. It is something I try very hard to be aware of and improve upon every day. I will continue to be self-aware with this matter and breathe before I speak.</p>
	<p>Finally, there is the matter of actually writing feedback. This has proven to be really difficult and isn't getting any easier. My meta feedback is indicating I am not doing a good job of providing actionable feedback, re the ASK method. This is sometimes a struggle because it seems like my pair did things really well and we worked on the problem effecitively and efficiently.</p>
