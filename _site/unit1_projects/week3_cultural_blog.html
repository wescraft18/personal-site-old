		<h2>'This is just one big experiment'</h2>
	<h5>Joey S. - 5/13/14</h5>
	<p>I'm not sure why this phrase, repeated by Shereef a few times, did not scare me at all but motivated me to give this my all. I'm pretty sure if you told anyone not in this program if they wanted to pay $12,000 for an experiment, their answer would be no.</p>
	<p>I typically find myself expecting the 'restaurant' whenever I pay for something so this will be a complete change in my mentality and I welcome the challenge as well as the opportunity to grow. My DBC expectations before this video haven't really changed after watching Shereef. Basically, I am under the impression that I will get my ass kicked in the next 18 weeks.</p>
	<p>The DBC experience is going to be one of constant development and leraning. I think, it will be a situation where you truly 'get out what you put in' and that seems great! The learning environment will undoubetdly be challenging and rewarding and I couldn't be more excited for it!</p>
